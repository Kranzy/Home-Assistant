# I have 2 UniFi AP's in my home:
#   - Centrally placed on the ground floor, having awesome coverage downstairs.
#   - Second is place on the stairway between the first floor and the attic,
#     giving me plenty of signal upstairs.
#
# I have a UniFi controller running 24/7 inside Hass.io,
# using the Community Hass.io add-on.
