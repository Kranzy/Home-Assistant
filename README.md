Home Assistant Configuration

The time has come to restart my home assistant journey with a brand new config layout.

I will be using Franck's config as inspiration to be more organised as my smart home evolves. Franck's repository can be found at https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config

I typically use Node-Red for my automations.
